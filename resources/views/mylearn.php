<?php
/*  $ npm install --save-dev bootstrap jquery popper.js sass sass-loader

I had this is issue when running "npm dev"
   'mix' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.
solution


it will happen when your cache hold previous files. clear the cache and install the npm again

npm cache clean --force then: npm install npm fix audit then: npm run development
